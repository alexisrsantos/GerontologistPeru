## Aging Across Unequal Landscapes in Perú: Demographic Transition, Diverging Paths and Policy Challenges

This repository contains the code needed to replicate our findings included in the International Spotlight published in The Gerontologist.

The file includes an R script and a post-processed dataset. 

* The RScript uses WPP data to produce Figure 1. 
* The RScript reads post-processed dataset (excel file included) to produce Figure 2.

Any questions should be directed to Dr. Alexis R. Santos (alexis at psu dot edu).
